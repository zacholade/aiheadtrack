# AI Head Tracking Peripheral Input

## What is this?
This is a work in progress AI head tracking library which allows you to use your head as an additional input for your computer. All you need is a webcam. The priority of this project is for the learning experience that it provides me.

## Use cases
- Leaning left and right in games such as Escape from Tarkov and PUBG, adding a whole new immersive layer.
- Controlling roll, yaw and pitch of your aircraft in flight simulators *(and submarine simulators?)*. 

## Features coming
- Actually make this library do what it should and track the head.
- Option of stream this data over UDP so that software such as [Opentrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) can smooth input, making it more useful and less chaotic in simulator games.
- Binding keypresses when your head exceeds a threshhold on a certain axis.
